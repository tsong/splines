    -note that if control points are not visible, you can't control or add new control points
The "Show Spline Segments" and "Show Basis Segments" menu items under "Show" toggles whether
spline or basis segments are colored distinctively.

Use the undo and redo commands under the "Edit" menu to undo and redo actions.
Use the "Order" menu to change the order of the B Spline basis functions

Drag the arrows beneath each knot in the parametric space to move the corresponding knot.
If the knots multiplicity is greater than 1:
    -left clicking drags the left most knot
    -right clicking drags the right most knot

The "Reset Knots" item under the "Edit" menu will reset the knots to their original uniform position.
